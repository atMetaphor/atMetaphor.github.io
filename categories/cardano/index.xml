So how do you tell one from another? Eleven years have elapsed since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the whitepaper and source code for Bitcoin. Kickstarting an explosion of technical innovations and yes, scams. Now in 2020 there are hundreds of projects and interoperating protocol, the digital equivalent of lego blocks for economic rules. With all of these projects and everyone talking their book, The noise it makes is all just so fuzzy.</description></item><item><title>EP2: Selecting a Stake Pool on Cardano</title><link>/ep2selecting-a-stake-pool-on-cardano/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:31:12 +1200</pubDate><guid>/ep2selecting-a-stake-pool-on-cardano/</guid><description>Thanks for tuning in. In this episode, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on Cardano and a process called stake-pool delegation.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering Cardano a lot in this channel, but in this episode I thought I would walk through understanding stake-pool metrics and how to delegate your Ada. I&amp;rsquo;ll look at setting up a Wallet, selecting a Stake-Pool, then delegating the Wallet to it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain the process using the the Daedalus Wallet.</description></item><item><title>EP1: Proof-of-Stake on Cardano</title><link>/ep1proof-of-stake-on-cardano/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:25:09 +1200</pubDate><guid>/ep1proof-of-stake-on-cardano/</guid><description>Decentralised finance continues the evolution of digital asset infrastructure toward lightweight forms of global finance. And like the crypto-currency era that underpins this radical experiment in economics, it comes with its own rapidly evolving uses and confusing language.
Tēnā koutou katoa, I&amp;rsquo;m Jack. Thanks for tuning in because I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on Cardano&amp;rsquo;s newly minted Shelly release, and with it, a process called Stake-Pool delegation. A process where you can accumulate ADA, earning income while supporting the operation of the Cardano Network— A genuinely decentralised network that doesn&amp;rsquo;t burn through the electricity of a small island nation to solve cryptographic puzzles.</description></item></channel></rss>
