So how do you tell one from another? Eleven years have elapsed since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the whitepaper and source code for Bitcoin. Kickstarting an explosion of technical innovations and yes, scams. Now in 2020 there are hundreds of projects and interoperating protocol, the digital equivalent of lego blocks for economic rules. With all of these projects and everyone talking their book, The noise it makes is all just so fuzzy.</p><p>Instead of trying to explain everything in one short blog, I&rsquo;m doing it in a series that explores Cardano; the vision, the mission, the technology and seeing how well that technology maps to declared statements. My particular focus is exploring how Blockchains and Cardano can be used within the Creative and Cultural arts sector.</p><p>Tēnā koutou katoa, after spending some time away I Finally made it back! If your new here dont forget to check out my youtube channel and follow me on twitte if you want keep up to date with what I&rsquo;m doing.</p><h2 id=blockchains-are-an-institutional-technology>Blockchains are an Institutional Technology</h2><p>Right lets get into the details!</p><p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of blockchain projects. No one knows what will work. The design space is too large. Despite the maximalists and shills, there is no one <strong>ideal</strong> project. No <strong>ideal</strong> community or network configuration. No <strong>ideal</strong> unit of value. As a result, the technology, the applications, and problems will continually evolve in unpredictable ways. Blockchains are an institutional technology, useful to coordinate the actions of crowds, platforms, and machines.</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/Meme_Coins.gif alt></p><p>All can be agents of free will. Just look at Defi, it makes the ICO craze of 2017 look like an ornamental cabbage. Well, they kinda were, to be honest.</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/Pedestal_Cabbage.gif alt></p><p>The architecture of the Internet evolves in a similar complex and chaotic environment. However, costs and value are external to the protocols, and that omission has resulted in a concentration of power. Value accounting is raison d' être of blockchains. Hence understanding the finance and economic mechanisms as well as their incentives are all part of the design problem.</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/evil_corps.gif alt></p><p>The upshot; The design space and local preferences are too diverse for any single network to win.</p><p>However, it is incorrect to assume every network will survive. Newer projects and associated tokens can turn out to be slow-motion pump-and-dumps. Charles Ponzi Madoff with Onecoin!</p><p><img src=/img/adamblk.png alt></p><p>And we&rsquo;re not out of the ICO nursery yet, many more projects will fail. Not because they set out to be scams. Like open-source projects in general, the real competitive threat for blockchains and any layer two protocol is abandonment and irrelevance. Software developers lose interest, Or more-likely speculators, marketers and sales folk lose, interest when the innovation premium flattens out. Occasionally and momentarily being brought back to life by a meme.</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/MEME_Coin.gif alt></p><h2 id=understanding-layer-2-protocols>Understanding Layer-2 protocols</h2><p>To understand any network or layer-2 protocol, you have to consider the technology, initial investment, economics, `community, and where the project sits in the broader blockchain ecosystem. If you accept those arguments, you can take one of two positions;</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/Investment_tech_community_arguements.gif alt></p><ol><li><p>Every project will evolve towards enhancing a single network because it is the only real source of value. This is a narrow interpretation of the network-effects argument that unpins the bitcoin &lsquo;maximalist&rsquo; position. Hayek would be spinning in his grave. The idea that there should be a single numéraire to measure and account for value is problematic on many levels. It would tend to amplify existing inequalities and inefficiencies.</p></li><li><p>The alternative is to view the blockchain ecosystem as a dynamic poly-centric network. An evolving system-of-systems. Where each blockchain network, public or private, considers their long-term sustainability and adapts to changes within their environment.</p></li></ol><p>Projects will be abandoned, others limp along, some will build long-term success. Nothing unusual, the whole process is a random walk. The blockchain ecosystem succeeds regardless. However, because digital technology is political, ideally society ends up being better off. An objective we need to be mindful of.</p><h2 id=desirble-network-properties>Desirble Network Properties</h2><p>Public blockchain networks, the associated market-based accounting and incentive structures that they enable, are distributed market-based organising systems. They are an embodiment of the Coasian firm; decentralised, networked and digitally native. Not a product. Not a business. You don&rsquo;t get a service-level agreement, and you don&rsquo;t call for support. They are political forms and therefore, political in nature. The &ldquo;service-level&rdquo; they provide is an emergent property of the community that surrounds the network. That community forms around desirable properties that reinforce a political and moral philosophy.</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/product_buiness_service.gif alt></p><p>Desirable properties include being fair and robust against attack or censorship. They need to be intentional about limiting the concentration of power and privilege; this leads to being owned and governed by a robust and engaged community What form it takes is a little more challenging to determine, but open networks that are decentralised will win long-term. As such, any open network needs to support monetary forms for transaction, speculation, and commitment. In a way individual preferences can be freely expressed. It needs to have an opinion on identity. It must support and form alliances, interoperating with other projects internally and across networks to remain relevant. Each project independently finding fitness in a particular niche, adapting as the whole ecosystem evolves.</p><p><img src=/gif/ep3/Decentralisation.gif alt></p><h2 id=a-decentralized-economy>A Decentralized Economy</h2><p>Ok, let&rsquo;s get the elephant out of the room. The majority of people interested in the crypto and DeFi space at the moment are speculators— &ldquo;Show me the money!&rdquo; type people. They aren&rsquo;t interested in anything else. Intentionally or not, they are funding the development of the underlying technology and market innovation. This is normal and good, just don&rsquo;t risk what you can&rsquo;t afford to lose.</p><p>In the thicket of techno-meme-filled foliage, it can be challenging to see the farming ecosystem for all the fertilised crops. I mean collective action through self-interest is the very definition of Adam&rsquo;s Smith&rsquo;s Invisible Hand. Co-operation and competition are antithetical to any good monopolist, ah hmm, I mean Capitalist or Bureaucrat.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the rub, do you build on someone else&rsquo;s platform or do you build your own. Building your own is expensive, but if it is someone else&rsquo;s the possibility that it can be pulled from under you is very real. You&rsquo;ll certainly end up paying higher rents.</p><p>Open, decentralised networks provide an alternative. They let you build on a shared foundation without becoming serfs. That is the fundamental reason why decentralisation matters. But being decentralised isn&rsquo;t a single factor, it is multifaceted, and it isn&rsquo;t a panacea. Good institutional design matters more than the rules which are embedded in the technical architecture, the design of incentives, the governance and the character of the network. All these are factored into the design.</p><p><img src=/img/chad_tweet.png alt></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nah! I gots to MAXIMISE MY ALPHA!&rdquo; ~ 0xc4ad</p></blockquote><p>Frankly, if all you care about is short-term yields, then the above statement isn&rsquo;t going to matter much. What does matter depends on a project&rsquo;s mission, vision, strategy and principles. The factors which determine the entire architecture for emergent ecosystems are not just technical but broadly encompass community structure and dynamics also.
