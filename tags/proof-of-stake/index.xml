In this episode, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on Cardano and a process called stake-pool delegation.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering Cardano a lot in this channel, but in this episode I thought I would walk through understanding stake-pool metrics and how to delegate your Ada. I&amp;rsquo;ll look at setting up a Wallet, selecting a Stake-Pool, then delegating the Wallet to it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain the process using the the Daedalus Wallet.</description></item><item><title>EP1: Proof-of-Stake on Cardano</title><link>/ep1proof-of-stake-on-cardano/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:25:09 +1200</pubDate><guid>/ep1proof-of-stake-on-cardano/</guid><description>Decentralised finance continues the evolution of digital asset infrastructure toward lightweight forms of global finance. And like the crypto-currency era that underpins this radical experiment in economics, it comes with its own rapidly evolving uses and confusing language.
Tēnā koutou katoa, I&amp;rsquo;m Jack. Thanks for tuning in because I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on Cardano&amp;rsquo;s newly minted Shelly release, and with it, a process called Stake-Pool delegation. A process where you can accumulate ADA, earning income while supporting the operation of the Cardano Network— A genuinely decentralised network that doesn&amp;rsquo;t burn through the electricity of a small island nation to solve cryptographic puzzles.</description></item></channel></rss>
